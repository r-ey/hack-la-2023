# This Project

Edu Metrics determine whether current modules on canvas is efficient and whether it could increase their grade.

# Reflection
## Approach
We find correlation between number of clicks on canvas, canvas screen time, and length of discussion of each student and compared them with students' grades.
The approach that we did was sorting the data first and remove unused data to make the data look clean and faster to load. Then, we make graph for each variable compared to their grades. Lastly, we find the correlation and p-value of each variables.
We wanted to see if current teaching modules are efficient for student and whether it could boost their grades. If the correlation and p-value are small, that means these variables does not affect student grades. Therefore, teachers could establish new topics or a more exciting subject for students to increase their grades as well as decrease their time spent on canvas.
We use python as it is easier to read from csv and make changes with it.
Each person is in charge for each variables and the we merge them into one code. Lastly, we make the presentation together.

## Wins / Challenges
Some challenges that we encounter would be that most of the data set have almost no correlation to grades. Therefore, it is hard to come up with something to support our project. Moreover, the number of dataset that we have is small, which makes our conclusion not that accurate. Furthermore, there are other lurking variables that affect students' grades.
We learn that not all data that looks correlate is correlate with each other.
We would try to make correlation with other variables and make our project more advanced and could be useful for both teacher and students.
