# This Project
> Link to presentation: 
This project finds correlation between number of clicks on canvas, canvas screen time, and length of discussion of each student and compared them with their grades.

# Reflection
## Approach
> What was your approach to the dataset? What problem did you want to solve? What technology did you decide to use? How did your team split the work?
The approach that we did was sorting the data first and remove unused data to make the data look clean and faster to load. Then, we make graph for each variable against grades. After that, we find the correlation and p-value of each variables.
We wanted to see if current teaching topics are attractive to student and whether it could boost their score. If the correlation and p-value are small, that means these variables does not affect student grades. Therefore, teachers could establish new topics or a more exciting subject for students to increase their grades as well as their time spent on canvas.
We use python as it is easier to read from csv and make changes with it.
We divide by variables for each person and merge them into one code. Then, we make the presentation together.

## Wins / Challenges
> Describe some wins / challenges. What did you learn? What would you do differently next time?
Some challenges that we encounter would be that most of the data set have weak or almost no correlation to grades. Therefore, it is hard to come up with something to support our project.
We learn that  
We would try to make correlation with other variables and make our project more advanced and could be useful for both teacher and students.
